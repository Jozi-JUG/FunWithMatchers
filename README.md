# FunWithMatchers
A demo Java project to illustrate the usage of matchers.

This project illustrates the following use cases:

1. No matchers: Using only `assertEquals()`.
1. Rolling your own custom Hamcrest `TypeSafeMatcher`.
1. Using Shazamcrest.
1. Matching the arguments of mock interactions with Mockito.

Look at the labels in the commit history for each of the above.
